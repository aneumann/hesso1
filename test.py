    # Do a basic implementation of JPEG.
    #     Divide the image into non-overlapping 8x8 blocks.
    #     Compute the DCT (discrete cosine transform) of each block. This is implemented in popular packages such as
    #       Matlab. Quantize each block. You can do this using the tables in the video or simply divide each coefficient
    #       by N, round the result to the nearest integer, and multiply back by N. Try for different values of N. You
    #       can also try preserving the 8 largest coefficients (out of the total of 8x8=64), and simply rounding them to
    #       the closest integer.
    #     Visualize the results after you invert the quantization and the DCT.
    # Repeat the above but instead of using the DCT, use the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform).
    # Repeat the above JPEG-type compression but donâ€™t use any transform, simply perform quantization on the original
    #   image.
    # Do JPEG now for color images. In Matlab, use the rgb2ycbcr command to convert the Red-Green-Blue image to a Lumina
    #   and Chroma one; then perform the JPEG-style compression on each one of the three channels independently. After
    #   inverting the compression, invert the color transform and visualize the result. While keeping the compression
    #   ratio constant for the Y channel, increase the compression of the two chrominance channels and observe the results.
    # Compute the histogram of a given image and of its prediction errors. If the pixel being processed is at coordinate
    #   (0,0), consider
    #     predicting based on just the pixel at (-1,0);
    #     predicting based on just the pixel at (0,1);
    #     predicting based on the average of the pixels at (-1,0), (-1,1), and (0,1).
    # Compute the entropy for each one of the predictors in the previous exercise. Which predictor will compress better?
